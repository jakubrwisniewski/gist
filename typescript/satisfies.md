# Satisfies 

> **note** Available in TypeScript `4.9`

[[DEV/Frameworki/TypeScript]] developers are often faced with a dilemma: we want to ensure that some expression *matches* some type, but also want to keep the *most specific* type of that expression for inference purposes.

For example:

```ts
// Each property can be a string or an RGB tuple.
const palette = {
    red: [255, 0, 0],
    green: "#00ff00",
    bleu: [0, 0, 255]
//  ^^^^ sacré bleu - we've made a typo!
};

// We want to be able to use array methods on 'red'...
const redComponent = palette.red.at(0);

// or string methods on 'green'...
const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```

Notice that we’ve written `bleu`, whereas we probably should have written `blue`. We could try to catch that `bleu` typo by using a type annotation on `palette`, but we’d lose the information about each property.

```ts
type Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";

type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];

const palette: Record<Colors, string | RGB> = {
    red: [255, 0, 0],
    green: "#00ff00",
    bleu: [0, 0, 255]
//  ~~~~ The typo is now correctly detected
};

// But we now have an undesirable error here - 'palette.red' "could" be a string.
const redComponent = palette.red.at(0);

```

The new `satisfies` operator lets us validate that the type of an expression matches some type, without changing the resulting type of that expression. As an example, we could use `satisfies` to validate that all the properties of `palette` are compatible with `string | number[]`:

```ts
type Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";

type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];

const palette = {
    red: [255, 0, 0],
    green: "#00ff00",
    bleu: [0, 0, 255]
//  ~~~~ The typo is now caught!
} satisfies Record<Colors, string | RGB>;

// Both of these methods are still accessible!
const redComponent = palette.red.at(0);
const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();

```

`satisfies` can be used to catch lots of possible errors. For example, we could ensure that an object has *all* the keys of some type, but no more:

```ts
type Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";

// Ensure that we have exactly the keys from 'Colors'.
const favoriteColors = {
    "red": "yes",
    "green": false,
    "blue": "kinda",
    "platypus": false
//  ~~~~~~~~~~ error - "platypus" was never listed in 'Colors'.
} satisfies Record<Colors, unknown>;

// All the information about the 'red', 'green', and 'blue' properties are retained.
const g: boolean = favoriteColors.green;

```

Maybe we don’t care about if the property names match up somehow, but we do care about the types of each property. In that case, we can also ensure that all of an object’s property values conform to some type.

```ts
type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];

const palette = {
    red: [255, 0, 0],
    green: "#00ff00",
    blue: [0, 0]
    //    ~~~~~~ error!
} satisfies Record<string, string | RGB>;

// Information about each property is still maintained.
const redComponent = palette.red.at(0);
const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();

```
