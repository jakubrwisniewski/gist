# Automatic capture from device camera

```html
<input type="file" capture="user" />
<input type="file" capture="environment" />
```

- `user` - should use front camera
- `environment` - should use rear camera

As of 10.10.2025, my testing on latest Android Chrome shows both captures modes use rear camera. Doesn't work on desktop browser.
